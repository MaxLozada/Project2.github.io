Docker Tutorial

	Configuring Apache For Docker:
		
		1. Boot up Git Bash or any type of command prompt and change directories to the directory that possesses your git repository.
		2. Next, type "vi Dockerfile" in the terminal to create and open a file called Dockerfile with the vi editor.
		3. Type in the following code:
			" FROM httpd:2.4
			  COPY ./public_html/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/"
		4. Once completed, press shift followed by two z presses to save the file. Now repeat the second step, but name the file "docker-compose.yml"
		5. Type in the following code:
			" version: "3.2"
			  services:
			    apache:
			      build: . 
			      ports:
			        - "8080:80"
			    volumes:
			        - ./public_html/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ "
		6. Press shift followed by two z presses to save the file and just like that you have configured the Apache server to run on Docker.
		7. Run the command "docker-compose up -d" in the terminal to start up the Apache Container. It will take a little bit of time to start up.
		8. Once the container finishes the start up process, open Docker Desktop to view that the container is running. You can either type in "http://localhost:8080/" or click on the container and click open in browser to view your Apache Web Server.
	Just like that, you have configured Apache to run on Docker. The next tutorial will show how to take this web server and host it to the Azure Cloud.
